# Little Window
> Little window is a clever little cat chatbot that directs women to the information they are looking for as quickly as possible. Think of it like google search on turbo for all of Chaynâ€™s resources and those provided by our friends too. We want to drastically reduce the time women take to search for information which in many cases can save lives.

**Currently in active development**

## Installing / Getting started

### Prerequisites
- Dialogflow key
- Googlesheets API key
- PostgreSQL Database

### Quick Start
1. Clone the repo:
`git clone git@github.com:chaynHQ/little-window.git`
2. Move into your newly created folder and install dependencies:
`npm install`
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory. This will need to include:
- `DATABASE_URL=` [Your PostgreSQL DB URL]
- `GOOGLE_API_1=` https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets/{your-sheet-id}/values/
- `GOOGLE_API_2=` ?key={your-GSheet-apikey}
- `DIALOGFLOW_PROJECT_ID=`
- `DIALOGFLOW_CLIENT_EMAIL=`
- `DIALOGFLOW_PRIVATE_KEY=`
All of the variables prefixed with DIALOGFLOW_ can be created by following the following instructions to generate a key: [Get Dialogflow key](https://dialogflow.com/docs/reference/v2-auth-setup?utm_source=msa&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=dialogflow_v1_deprecationauth_setup). Then follow this tutorial to include them in your .env file: [Include in .env file](https://medium.com/@tzahi/how-to-setup-dialogflow-v2-authentication-programmatically-with-node-js-b37fa4815d89).
4. Run the app in dev mode:
`npm run dev`

### Testing
1. Run `npm test` from the root folder to run server tests.
2. Run `cd client` then `npm test` to run React tests.

## Dialogflow

You can setup your conversation flow in Dialogflow using the following guidelines:

### Payloads

- All intents need to send back a custom payload, even if it's just an empty object

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24212625/37565404-c848897e-2aa0-11e8-9c9b-b00698701114.png)

### Option buttons

- For options buttons, send an `options` property in the custom payload. This is an array of objects for each button, where each object contains a `text` and `postback` key & value. `text` is the value that will appear on the button, `postback` is the actual value that will be sent to Dialogflow - this should map to the utterance of next intent you want to trigger with that button.

- If it is intended that by selecting the relevant option that resources will be displayed to the user, the `postback` on the button should also be the reference for the server to lookup the correct columns in a Google Sheet.

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24212625/37565424-38e4102c-2aa1-11e8-91ad-2d6b7cfa83da.png)

- The message that is then returned by Dialogflow in response to the postback should contain a value of `"resources": "true"`, which then triggers this lookup:

### Selecting multiple buttons

- If it is intended that multiple options can be selected for a set of buttons, which are then submitted:

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24212625/37565312-f5a33fce-2a9e-11e8-9f43-ef0769fb4fe1.png)

- Then the payload should contain a `selectOptions` property which is an array of objects for each option, where each object contains a `text`, `postback` and `lookup` value. However in contrast to the button options, instead of the `postback` being the lookup to the Google Sheet, the `lookup` value should map to the relevant columns in the Google Sheet. The user can then select multiple options before submitting.

### Multiple messages

- Where multiple messages are to be displayed to the user, without any user input, each message where there should be a followup message from the bot should contain a `retrigger` property for which the value maps to the utterance for the intent for the next message:

### Message speed

- As in the above screenshot, each message can be given a `time delay` in the payload of `slow` (5secs) or `superslow` (8secs) to slow down the speed of a given bot response. The standard speed is 1.5secs.
